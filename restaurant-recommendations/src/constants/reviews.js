    content: 'As a survivor of the Chipotle E.Coli epidemic, I can confidently say that Chipotle is worth the risk of infection. Make sure to order a bowl, and ask for extra of all toppings to get your money\'s worth. Even though the guac is extra, Chipotle is my number one fast casual choice any day.'
