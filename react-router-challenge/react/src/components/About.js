    <h3>Thanks for stopping by.</h3>
    <p>
      I majored in English in college and, after graduation, took an HTML and CSS class and fell in love with programming. In 2017, I enrolled in Launch Academy to learn full-stack web development and have never looked back! I am passionate about learning new programming languages and tools, always eager to better myself, and hopeful about using my knowledge to make a real difference.
